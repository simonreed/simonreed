# Freelance senior Ruby and React developer as and when you need it.

I have 15 years of experience working to create web application software. Read on to find out more about my skills/experiences.

I work with a small number of long term clients so that they can have the flexibility to easily scale up and down their development when they need to. I emphasise building long term relationships and often my client will work with me for many years. 

To ensure that I'm around for my clients when they need me I work around 5-20 days a month for any single client and will work with multiple clients a month. 

This allows me keep my skills sharp and my interest keen while giving me a great opportunity to bring best practices and ideas across from project to project. It's really allowed me to supercharge my experiences across industries, technologies and processes and honestly I love being a freelancer.
