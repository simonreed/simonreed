### I'm a senior developer when you need one.

I'm an independent Ruby (on Rails) developer based just outside London, UK with over 10 years experience.

I help people make great web applications that make my clients more money and their businesses run more efficiently.

I've worked on a wide range of projects, small and large. My clients include bootstrap startups, VC backed startups through to creative agencies.
